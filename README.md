Are you a rock climber? Do you love exploring new, untouched terrain? If so, this program is for you! Rock Hunter uses elevation data to find potential cliffs and bouldering fields.

How to use:
- To use this program to find potential rocks/cliffs, start by downloading a digital terrain elevation data (.DTED) file
  - To download files for your area, head to https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ and create an account
  - Select the desired region in the map window (you can do  this by clicking on four points to create a polygon)
  - Click the "Data Sets" button at the bottom of the left window
  - Go to the "Digital Elevation" tab, then under "SRTM," select "SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global."
  - Click the "results" button at the bottom of the left window
  - The titles that cover your selected area will appear in the left window. Click on the footprint button to overlay each tile's coverage, or download the files.
- drag and drop your DTED files into the dted folder
- input the parameters at the top of the rockHunter.py script
- run rockHunter.py
